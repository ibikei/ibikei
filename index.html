<h1>ibikei SSG</h1>
<p>an SSG made in bash.</p>
<h1>IBK-Lang</h1>
<p>a markup language that has been made just for this project</p>
<h2>how does any of this work??!!</h2>
<p>you make an .ibkx file and write IBK-Lang in it.
IBK-Lang is the language used in place of Markdown for the input files.
you then run the ibikei.sh script using the following syntax:</p>
<p>./ibikei.sh <input file> <output file></p>
<p>in the case of the website that has been written here,</p>
<code>./ibikei.sh index.ibkx index.html</code>
<p>it'll source the .ibkx file, and will go through every line progressively</p>
